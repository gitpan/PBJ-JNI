PBJ/JNI/Native version 0.01
============================

This is one of the modules in the PBJ::JNI suite.  This module
implements the primitive interface to the Java JNI C library.  It
is not recommanded that this module be used directly.  Rather, the
other modules in the PBJ::JNI suite, namely

PBJ::JNI::JavaVM
PBJ::JNI::JNIEnv
PBJ::JNI::Util

should be used directly.

As with all modules in the PBJ::JNI suite, PBJ::JNI::Native handles
pointers returned from the C library directly.  So you are supposed 
to know what you are doing when calling these function in this 
module, or risk crashing your program with no or very limited
information.


INSTALLATION

Please install PBJ::JNI as a whole.


DEPENDENCIES

JDK version 1.2 or later, or its equivalent Java virtual machine 
implementation must be installed seperately before these modules 
can be installed.
